*** Tests Directory ***
This directory contains autogenerated tests for your services.

Diretory holds inside:
  - tests.py - main file with test cases inside, grouped into classes by service
  - authentication.py - a file to inject authentication into tests, look inside it for details
  - data - a directory that contains datasets, body payloads and service-to-URL map
  - up9lib - UP9 helper library with functions and classes

*** Prerequisites to run tests ***
Just install several dependencies from PyPi:
  pip3 install apiritif jsonpath_ng lxml pytest ddt

*** How to run all tests ***
Havigate into this directory and run Pytest command:
  pytest -v tests.py

*** How to run single test ***
Locate the test you want to run, then specify its class name and test case name for Pytest. For example:
  pytest -v tests.py::Tests_api_mysvc_io::test_01_post_api_v1_order__8

*** How to change base URL for services ***
The mapping of service-to-URL is located in `data/target_services.json` file.
Use that file as central place to edit base URLs.
Additionally, you can set the address via environment variables, it will have precedence over file.
